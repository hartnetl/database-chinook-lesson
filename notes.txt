Steps taken:

DOWNLOAD CHINOOK FILES  
* type "wget wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_PostgreSql.sql"
into the terminal.  
This downloads the postgres chinook file into our file explorer.  

CREATE CHINOOK DATABASE  
* Enter the following into the terminal:  
    set_pg (This needs to be done everytime you open the workspace)
    psql (This opens postgres)
    \l (to view databases)
    CREATE DATABASE chinook; (Create new database. Don't forget the ; )
    \c database_name (switch between databases)

INSTALL CHINOOK
* Enter this into the terminal:  
\i Chinook_PostgreSql.sql   
the filename is the one that was downloaded from the wget command above. 
The installation takes a few minutes.

TEST IT INSTALLED CORRECTLY
* \q (QUIT THE SERVER)
* q (quit search)
* psql -d chinook (connect to chinook)
* \dt (display tables from database)
* SELECT * FROM "Artist"; (get all artists - always use double quotes here)
* SELECT NAME FROM "Artist";"
* SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE "Name" = 'Queen';
* SELECT * FROM "Album" WHERE "ArtistId" = 51;
* SELECT * FROM "Track" WHERE "Composer" = Queen;

SEND RESULTS TO CSV AND JSON FILES
* \copy (SELECT * FROM "Track" WHERE "Composer" = 'Queen') TO 'test.csv' WITH CSV DELIMITER ',' HEADER;  
\o test.json  
SELECT json_agg(t) FROM (SELECT * FROM "Track" WHERE "Composer" = 'Queen') t; 

alt + sht + f on json file to format

INSTALL PSYCOPG2
* pip3 install psycopg2
* Create python file sql-psycopg2.python
* Fill it out as per the file
        *
        import psycopg2

        # connect to "chinook" database
        connection = psycopg2.connect(database="chinook")

        # build a cursor object of the database. A cursor is a list, like an array in JS
        # anything that we query from the database will become part of this cursor object,
        # and to read that data, we should iterate over the cursor using a for-loop, as an example.
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        # Enter queries here, one by one

        # Query 1 - select all records from the "Artist" table
        # cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM "Artist"')

        # fetch the results (multiple)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Or use this to fetch one result (single)
        # results = cursor.fetchone()

        # close the connection
        connection.close()

        # print results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
