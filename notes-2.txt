INSTALL SQLAlchemy

    * pip3 install SQLAlchemy

CREATE SQL-EXPRESSSION.PY FILE
    Set it up as follows:

        from sqlalchemy import (
            create_engine, Table, Column, Float, ForeignKey, Integer, String, MetaData
        )

        # executing the instructions from our localhost "chinook" db
        db = create_engine("postgresql:///chinook")

        meta = MetaData(db)

        # making the connection
        with db.connect() as connection:

ADD YOUR QUERIES

    Run chinook 
        * set_pg
        * psql -d chinook
        * SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE false;
            # This step above is the quickest way to view the headers of the Artist table
            # We get ArtistId and name, so these can be added to your query
